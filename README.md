Dataset and Description
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is a dataset used for the detection of breast cancer. It includes features used to classify whether breast cells are cancerous or not. These features consist of various cellular properties such as uniformity of cell nucleus, cell shape and size, and a total of 683 observations.

The dataset is divided into two classes: Malignant tumors (4) and Benign tumors (2). These two classes indicate whether the breast cells are cancerous.

There are 10 integer type variables:

Sample code number: ID number
Clump Thickness: 1 - 10
Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10
Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10
Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10
Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10
Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10
Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10
Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10
Mitoses: 1 - 10

In my Breast Cancer dataset, we reached the conclusion that the "benign" class has more instances compared to the "malignant" class, with a total of 444 examples. When analyzing the data based on the given variables, we can make the interpretation that the more common cancer cell is benign.

Statistically speaking, with a good accuracy rate, we can develop a prediction about the general characteristics of the dataset and the relationships between classes. Considering the number and values of variables, I believe that the diagnosis of malignant cancer cells could be better determined.

I believe that the challenges encountered may stem from incorrect data entry and subsequent misinterpretation. These difficulties can complicate the breast cancer diagnosis process.
